About
=====
STAK (the STScI Analysis Toolkit) is a general purpose library to provide
computational resources for astronomical data reduction and analysis.

Part of this effort is also to ease the transition from legacy IRAF scripts and
analysis routines into the Python ecosystem.  For help translation your IRAF
functions into their Python equivalent, see our `notebook tutorials <http://stak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/index.html>`_.

You can read the full specification at `the online documentation <http://stak.readthedocs.io/>`_.
